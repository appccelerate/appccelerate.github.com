<h2>Registration over Interface</h2>
<p>
If you have multiple implementations of an interface (for example a plug-in), you can define on the interface itself, which events or event handler methods should by used. 
This allows you to define the interaction with the event broker once on the interface for all implementations.
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
public interface MyInterface
{
  [EventPublication("topic://Publish")]
  event EventHandler Event;

  [EventSubscription("topic://Subscribe", typeof(OnPublisher))]
  void Handle(object sender, EventArgs eventArgs);
}
]]></script>
<p>
The class implementing the interface mustn't repeat the attributes or register the event or event handler method over the registrar.
This would result in an exception during registration.
</p>
