<h1>IO Access</h1>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
The .Net framework doesn't provide a convenient way to intercept or test calls to the file system.
</p>
<p>
The Access namespace of Appccelerate provides an abstraction over the .Net file system classes that allow both extensibility and testability.
</p>

<h2>Sample</h2>
<p>
Instead of using the .net framework classes directly like <code>File.WriteAllText</code>, use an <code>IAccessFactory</code> to create a <code>File</code>. 
And then write the file.
</p>
<p>
The <code>File</code> class and all other abstraction classes provide exactly the same methods as the original ones from the .Net framework.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
using Appccelerate.IO

public class Program
{
    public void Main()
    {
        var accessFactory = new AccessFactory();
        var worker = new Worker(accessFactory);

        worker.WriteFile();
    }
}

public class Worker
{
    private readonly IAccessFactory accessFactory;

    public Worker(IAccessFactory accessFactory)
    {
        this.accessFactory = accessFactory;
    }

    public void WriteFile()
    {
        this.accessFactory.CreateFile().WriteAllText("c:\\folder\\filename.extension", "this is the content");
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Testability</h2>
<p>
Using the indirection via the access factory allows you to test this code without really writing to the file system.
</p>

<h3>Faking <code>IFile</code>, <code>IDirectory</code> etc.</h3>
<p>
One way to test code interacting with the file system is to fake the classes that make calls to the file system:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
public class SampleTest
{
    private readonly Worker testee;

    private readonly IAccessFactory accessFactory;

    public Samples()
    {
        this.accessFactory = A.Fake&lt;IAccessFactory&gt;();

        this.testee = new Worker(this.accessFactory);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void WritesAFile()
    {
        var file = A.Fake&lt;IFile&gt;();
        A.CallTo(() => this.accessFactory.CreateFile())
            .Returns(file);

        this.testee.WriteFile();

        A.CallTo(() => file.WriteAllText("c:\\folder\\filename.extension", "this is the content"))
            .MustHaveHappened();
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
This unit test is written using xUnit (test framework) and FakeItEasy (fake/mock library).
</p>
<p>
The test checks whether the file was written to the expected path and with the expected content by verifying that the corresponding call on the <code>IFile</code> was made.
</p>
<p>
Faking is best suited for unit tests for classes with little interaction or lot of special cases like access violations and so on.
</p>

<h3>In-memory File System</h3>
<p>
Another way to test code interacting with the file system is to use the in-memory file system:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
public class SampleTest
{
    private readonly Worker testee;

    private readonly IAccessFactory accessFactory;

    public Samples()
    {
        this.accessFactory = new InMemoryAccessFactory();

        this.testee = new Worker(this.accessFactory);
    }

[Fact]
public void WritesAFile()
{
    this.testee.WriteFile();

    accessFactory.FileSystem.FileExists("c:\\folder\\filename.extension")
        .Should().BeTrue();
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
This test checks whether a file was written, by inspecting the in-memory file system.
</p>
<p>
The in-memory file system is best suited in tests that have a lot of interaction with the file system. For example in acceptance tests.
Using the in-memory file system leads to simpler to understand tests that setting up all the fake calls as seen above.
Testing special cases however is tricky.
</p>

<h4>Current Limitations</h4>
<p>
The in-memory file system is only partly implemented at the moment (there are really a lot of methods to interact with the file system!).
More will be added in the future. Or just contribute what you need ;-)
</p>
<p>
You cannot use the in-memory file system together with extensions. This is something we are working on.
</p>

<h2>Extensibility</h2>
<p>
The access factory allows to register extensions.
</p>
<p>
For every call to the file system (e.g. <code>File.ReadAllBytes</code>), all registered file extensions get a call to
<ul>
    <li><code>Begin&lt;MethodName&gt;</code> before the operation is executed</li>
    <li><code>End&lt;MethodName&gt;</code> after the operation executed successfully</li>
    <li><code>Fail&lt;MethodName&gt;</code> when the operation threw an exception</li>
</ul>
with <code>&lt;MethodName&gt;</code> being the name of the method that is/was called.
</p>
<p>
The <code>Begin&lt;MethodName&gt;</code> methods have the same arguments as the method being called.
</p>
<p>
The <code>End&lt;MethodName&gt;</code> methods have no arguments for void methods and the result of the called method otherwise.
</p>
<p>
The <code>Fail&lt;MethodName&gt;</code> methods have the thrown exception as the argument. <i>(we are currently working on adding the original arguments)</i>
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
This example shows how to add an extension that logs <code>File.WriteAllText</code> calls.<br>
Add the extension:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
accessFactory.RegisterFileExtensionsProvider(() => new[] { new LogFileExtension() });
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Write the extension:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
public class LogFileExtension : FileExtensionBase
{
    public override void BeginWriteAllText(string path, string contents)
    {
        // log that operation begins
    }

    public override void EndWriteAllText(string path, string contents)
    {
        // log that operation ended successfully
    }

    public override void FailWriteAllText(ref Exception exception)
    {
        // log that operation failed
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
There exist base classes for all extension types so that you only have to implement the methods you are interested in.
</p>
<p>
There are the following types of extensions:
<ul>
    <li><code>IFileExtension</code></li>
    <li><code>IDirectoryExtension</code></li>
    <li><code>IPathExtension</code></li>
    <li><code>IEnvironmentExtension</code></li>
    <li><code>IDriveExtension</code></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<i>Note:</i>
If you want to intercept all calls to the file system, you can either implement an extension per extension type and implement all methods of these, or use a code weaver (PostSharp, Fody) to create this code.
</p>

<h2>Road Map</h2>
<p>
What we intend to add to the IO Access namespace in the future.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fail methods in extensions get access to original arguments.</li>
    <li>Extensions can be used together with the in-memory file system.</li>
</ul>
