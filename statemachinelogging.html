<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>
There exists a log4net extension that provides logging using log4net. 
Please, download the nuget package Appccelerate.SourceTemplates to get the sample code. 
You can either take the source as is, or change it so it meets your logging requirements.
</p>

<p>
You can add an instance of the <code>Appccelerate.Log4Net.StateMachineLogExtension</code> to the state machine:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
stateMachine.AddExtension(new StateMachineLogExtension<States, Events>());
]]></script>

<p>
You can define the logger that log4net uses by specifing the name in the constructor:
</p>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
stateMachine.AddExtension(new StateMachineLogExtension<States, Events>("my.logger.name"));
]]></script>


<h3>custom logging</h3>
<p>
If you want to change either the logging framework or what and how is logged then you can write your own logging extension.
