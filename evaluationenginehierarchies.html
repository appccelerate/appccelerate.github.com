<h2>Hierarchical Evaluation Engines</h2>
<p>
An evaluation engine can have a parent evaluation engine:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
var parentEngine = new EvaluationEngine();
var childEngine = new EvaluationEngine(parentEngine);
]]></script>
<p>
When you ask the child engine a question, it will use all the expressions of the parent and the child.
When you ask the parent engine, it will only use the expressions known to the parent.
</p>
<p>
If the child engine defines an aggregator, the child aggregator will be used when asking a question on the child. Thus overriding the parent aggregator.
</p>
