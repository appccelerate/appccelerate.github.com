<h2>Coding</h2>
<h3 id="codingguidelines">Do I really have to follow all this coding guidelines (StyleCop, MSBuild Tasks, Unit Tests, ...)</h3>
<p>
We value the benefits of coding guidelines higher than the resulting needed effort.
We like that the code looks the same no matter who wrote it. This makes reading other people's code much easier.
</p>
<p>
If you struggle too much with these guidelines, ignore them and open a pull request.
We will do the rest. 
But of course, it will take much more time to integrate your changes.
</p>

<h2>Nuget</h2>
<h3 id="restorefailed">Nuget packages cannot be restored</h3>
<p>
During development, all Appccelerate nuget packages are staged on the Appccelerate nuget feed on MyGet.
</p>
<p>
The nuget.config inside every Appccelerate project should tell nuget to go look there for packages.
Unfortunately, this does not work on every machine.
</p>
<p>
If you cannot restore the packages, add a package source for the feed <code>https://www.myget.org/F/appccelerate/</code>
