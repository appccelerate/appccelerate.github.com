<h1>MSBuild Tasks</h1>
<p>
The MSBuild tasks of Appccelerate are little helpers to make development easier.
</p>
<p>
They are executed as part of a build. Therefore, no additional scripting is needed.
</p>
<p>
All tasks can be installed into your projects with Nuget.
</p>
<p>
Check out the MSBuild tasks (navigation on the right).
