<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>

<h3>Using multiple Event Brokers</h3>
<p>
When only groups of publisher and subscribers should communicate with each other, you can use multiple event brokers, one per group.
Only the subscribers registered on the same event broker as the publisher get notified. 
You still have the possibility to register an object on two or more event brokers to communicate with several groups.
