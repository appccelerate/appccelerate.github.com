	<h2>Setup of the distributed event broker</h2>
	<p>The usage of the distributed event broker is astonishingly simple when you have prepared your transport layer. Basically it is only two lines of code. </p>
	<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[// Use existing event broker or create special one for distributed events
var eventBroker = new EventBroker();

// Use extension method AddDistributedExtension
var extension = // new TechnologySpecificDistributedEventBrokerExtension
eventBroker.AddDistributedExtension(extension);
    ]]>
