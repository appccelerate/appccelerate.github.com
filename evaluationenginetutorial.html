<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>
The questioner has two questions that have to be answered:
</p>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[

    {
        this.evaluationEngine = evaluationEngine;
    }

    {
        string coolness = this.evaluationEngine.Answer(new HowCoolIsTheEvaluationEngine());

		const string SampleText = "sample Text";
        int vowels = this.evaluationEngine.Answer(
            new HowManyVowelsAreInThisText { CountLetters = HowManyVowelsAreInThisText.Letters.Small }, 
            SampleText);

        string message = string.Format(
            CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
            "knowing that {0} has {1} vowels is {2} cool!",
            SampleText,
            vowels,
            coolness);
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}
]]></script>
<p>
The first question (<code>HowCoolIsTheEvaluationEngine</code>) is a parameter-less question, 
the second (<code>HowManyVowelsAreInThisText</code>) a question with a parameter (= the text to process).
</p>
<p>
The answerer knows how this questions can be solved:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
/// <summary>
/// Knows how questions can be answered and defines the solution strategy on the evaluation engine.

public class Answerer
{
    private readonly IEvaluationEngine evaluationEngine;

    /// <summary>

    public void PrepareAnswers()
    {
        this.evaluationEngine.Solve<HowCoolIsTheEvaluationEngine, string>()
            .AggregateWithExpressionAggregator(
			    string.Empty, 
				(aggregate, value) => aggregate + " " + value)
            .ByEvaluating((q, p) => "extremely")
            .ByEvaluating((q, p) => "super")
            .ByEvaluating((q, p) => "fantastic");

        this.evaluationEngine.Solve<HowManyVowelsAreInThisText, int, string>()
            .AggregateWithExpressionAggregator(
			    0, 
				(aggregate, value) => aggregate + value)
            .When(q => q.CountLetters == HowManyVowelsAreInThisText.Letters.Small)
                .ByEvaluating(q => new CountVowelExpression { Vowel = 'a' })
                .ByEvaluating(q => new CountVowelExpression { Vowel = 'e' })
                .ByEvaluating(q => new CountVowelExpression { Vowel = 'i' })
                .ByEvaluating(q => new CountVowelExpression { Vowel = 'o' })
                .ByEvaluating(q => new CountVowelExpression { Vowel = 'u' })
            .When(q => q.CountLetters == HowManyVowelsAreInThisText.Letters.Capital)
                .ByEvaluating(q => new CountVowelExpression { Vowel = 'A' })
                .ByEvaluating(q => new CountVowelExpression { Vowel = 'E' })
                .ByEvaluating(q => new CountVowelExpression { Vowel = 'I' })
                .ByEvaluating(q => new CountVowelExpression { Vowel = 'O' })
                .ByEvaluating(q => new CountVowelExpression { Vowel = 'U' });
    }
}
]]></script>
<p>
The coolness question is answered by concatenating the results of the individual expressions (here, inline expressions are used).
</p>
<p>
The vowel counting question is answered depending on whether capital or small letters should be count. 
The total number is calculated as the sum of the counts of the individual vowels.
</p>
<p>
The <code>CountVowelExpression</code> counts the number of a specific vowel:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
/// <summary>
/// Expression for counting vowels in a string.
/// </summary>
public class CountVowelExpression : IExpression<int, string>
{
	/// <summary>
	/// Gets or sets the vowel to count.
	/// </summary>
	/// <value>The vowel tocount.</value>
	public char Vowel { get; set; }

	/// <summary>
	/// Evaluates the number of <see cref="Vowel"/> in the passed parameter.
	/// </summary>
	/// <param name="parameter">The parameter.</param>
	/// <returns>The number of occurences.</returns>
	public int Evaluate(string parameter)
	{
		return parameter.Count(c => c == this.Vowel);
	}

	/// <summary>
	/// Describes this instance.
	/// </summary>
	/// <returns>The description of this instance.</returns>
	public string Describe()
	{
		return "counts the number of " + this.Vowel;
	}
}
]]></script>
<p>
The console output of calling <code>Ask</code> on the questioner results in:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
knowing that sample Text has 3 vowels is  extremely super fantastic cool!
]]></script>

<p>
You can use the log4net log extension found in the Appccelerate.SourceTemplates package to log using log4net (or your own logging extension for other logging frameworks).
Answering the coolness question results in the following log:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: plain"><![CDATA[
INFO - Question = how cool is the evaluation engine?
Answer =  extremely super fantastic
Used strategy = aggregator strategy
Used Aggregator = expression aggregator with seed '' and aggregate function (aggregate, value) => ((aggregate + " ") + value)
Expressions =
    inline expression = (q, p) => "extremely" => extremely
    inline expression = (q, p) => "super" => super
    inline expression = (q, p) => "fantastic" => fantastic
]]></script>
<p>
Answering the vowel counting results in the following log:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: plain"><![CDATA[
INFO - Question = how many Small vowels are in this text?
Parameter = sample Text
Answer = 3
Used strategy = aggregator strategy
Used Aggregator = expression aggregator with seed '0' and aggregate function (aggregate, value) => (aggregate + value)
Expressions =
    counts the number of a => 1
    counts the number of e => 2
    counts the number of i => 0
    counts the number of o => 0
    counts the number of u => 0
]]></script>
