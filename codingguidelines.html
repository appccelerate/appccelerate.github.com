<p>
We are very happy about pull requests. 
Please follow these coding guidelines to help us integrate your changes.
</p>

<h2>ATDD and TDD</h2>
<p>
All code is developed Test Driven using ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development) and TDD (Test Driven Development).
</p>

<h2>StyleCop</h2>
<p>
All code (production, unit test and specifications) are checked by StyleCop. We have different StyleCop settings files for each type of assembly. Please check the existing settings if you add a new project.
</p>

<h2>Code Analysis</h2>
<p>
We use Code Analysis to check for common programming mistakes.
Unfortunately, we cannot run it automatically during building anymore. So please, run it before making the pull request.
</p>
<p>
Suppressions are okay if they are commented and reasonable.
</p>

<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
<h3>Unit Tests</h3>
<p>
Unit test methods should follow the convention:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Behavior</i> for testing a feature</li>
    <li><i>Behavior</i>_When<i>Scenario</i> for testing a special case of a feature</li>
    <li><i>Behavior</i>On<i>Cause</i> for testing a feature that is cause by an event, trigger, ...</li>
    <li><i>Behavior</i>On<i>Cause</i>_When<i>Scenario</i> for chechick all above at once</li>
</ul>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>ReturnsTodaysWheather</li>
    <li>ReturnsSunny_WhenItIsSunday</li>
    <li>ThrowsInvalidOperationExceptionOnRequestingMoonWeather</li>
</ul>

<p>
Final note: this guidelines apply to all newly written code. Some existing code may not follow these guidelines and needs refactoring (shame on us).
</p>
