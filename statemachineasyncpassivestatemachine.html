<h2>Async Passive State Machine</h2>

<p>
The <code>AsyncPassiveStateMachine</code> is a state machine that supports async/await for transition actions, entry/exit actions, guards and save/load.
Like the <code>PassiveStatemachine</code> it performs transitions on the same thread as the code calling the state machine. 
That means that when the call to <code>Fire</code> returns to the caller and the returned task is awaited then the transition is performed.
</p>

<h3>State Machine Events Execution</h3>
<p>
All events fired onto the state machine are executed on the same async/await chain as the caller.
</p>

<h3>Actions queueing events</h3>
<p>
When a transition, exit or entry action fires an event onto the state machine then this event is executed immediately after the initial event is processed and before task returned by <code>Fire</code> is completed.
</p>
