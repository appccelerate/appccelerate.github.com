<h2>Setup of the mapping event broker</h2>
<p>The usage of the mapping event broker is astonishingly simple once you have setup your mapping technology. Basically it is only two lines of code. </p>
	<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[// Use existing event broker or create special one for events which need to be mapped
var eventBroker = new EventBroker();

// Use extension method AddMappingExtension
var extension = // new TechnologySpecificMappingEventBrokerExtension
eventBroker.AddMappingExtension(extension);
    ]]>
	</script>
