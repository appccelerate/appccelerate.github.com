<h2>Road Map</h2>
<p>
The main input for Appcceleration is the feedback from the real world projects we work in.
</p>
<p>
These are the features we're up to in the future:
<ul>
  <li>AsyncModule: Rewrite to make it easier to use and better testable, once .Net 4.5 is released.</li>
  <li>Bootstrapper: client/server extension support</li>
  <li>Bootstrapper: serviceinstaller</li>
  <li>EventBroker: support simplified handler method signatures (no need for sender or event args if they are not used).</li>
  <li>Feature, license and user permission management over the evaluation engine</li>
  <li>UI navigation for WPF and Web (URL based)</li>
</ul>
