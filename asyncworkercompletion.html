<h2>Execute Code on Completion</h2>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
DoWorkEventHandler worker = delegate(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
{
    e.Result = "the result";
};

RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler completed = 
    delegate(object sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)
{
    // do something with the result, e.g. updating the UI, no thread switching needed
    object result = e.Result;
};

AsyncWorker asyncWorker = new AsyncWorker(worker, completed);

asyncWorker.RunWorkerAsync();
]]></script>

<p>
The completion callback will be called on the thread on which the async worker was started if this thread supports synchronization (UI thread do support synchronization).
Otherwise, it will be called on the worker thread.
