<h2>How to migrate from bbv.Common</h2>
<p>
This page explains the changes we made when we renamed the project and cleaned-up its structure.
</p>

<h3>Event Broker</h3>

<h4>Renaming of subscription handlers</h4>
<p>
The built-in subscription handler were renamed because they were confusing:
<ul>
	<li>Publisher is now OnPublisher</li>
	<li>Background is now OnBackground</li>
	<li>Interface is now OnInterface</li>
	<li>InterfaceAsync is now OnInterfaceAsync</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>State Machine</h3>

<h4>Changed syntax to build hierarchies</h4>
<p>
Old: <code>machine.DefineHierarchyOn(SuperState, InitialLeafState, HistoryType, InitialLeafState, AnotherLeafState, YetAnotherLeafState)</code>
New: <code>machine.DefineHierarchyOn(SuperState).WithHistoryType(HistoryType).WithInitialSubState(InitialLeafState).WithSubState(AnotherLeafState).WithSubState(YetAnotherLeafState)</code>
</p>

<h4>Changed how multiple actions are defined to allow mixing of actions with and without access to the event argument</h4>
<p>
Old: <code>machine.In(SomeState).On(SomeEvent).Execute(Action1, Action2)</code>
New: <code>machine.In(SomeState).On(SomeEvent).Execute(Action1).Execute(Action2)</code>
</p>

<h4>Entry and Exit actions can now have access to the event argument</h4>
<p>
Now it is possible to access the event argument in entry and exit actions:
<code>machine.In(SomeState).ExecuteOnEntry<int>(argument => { ... }).ExecuteOnExit<int>(argument => { ... })</code>
</p>

<h4>ExceptionThrown event was removed</h4>
<p>
All exceptions are now passed to the event <code>TransitionExceptionThrown</code>.
Therefore, you only need to listen to a single event now.
</p>


<h3>Evaluation Engine</h3>

<h4>Introduced interface IAnswerer to be compliant with Interface Segregation Principle</h4>
<p>
This new interface allows to inject an evaluation engine with just access to the <code>Answer</code> methods.
</p>


<h3>IO</h3>
<h4>IIOAccessFactory</h4>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Renamed IIOAccessFactory to IAccessFactory</li>
    <li>Changed registering of extensions</li>
    <li>New IDrive and IEnvironment</li>
    <li>Removed 'Access' from every method name and interface name (except IAccessFactory of course)</li>
<ul>
</p>


<h3>Logging</h3>
<p>
All log4net loggers were removed from the binaries and moved to a source code nuget package: Appccelerate.SourceCodeTemplates.
This simplifies modifying logging to your needs.
</p>


<h3>Csv Parser / Writeer</h3>
<p>
Moved to Appccelerate.IO package.
</p>


<h3>UserInterfaceThreadSynchronizer</h3>
<p>
Moved to Appccelerate.Async package.
</p>

<h3>bbv.Common package</h3>
<p>
Package was replaced with Appccelerate.Fundamentals package.
</p>
