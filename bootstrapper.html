<h3>
    <a name="Bootstrapper"></a>Bootstrapper<a href="#Bootstrapper" ></a></h3>
<p>
    When building a new application the bootstrapper is essentially the only root object
    which needs to be instantiated in your application main method. The bootstrapper
    is the central point of your application&#x27;s startup and shutdown behavior.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="Extensions"></a>Extensions<a href="#Extensions" ></a></h3>
<p>
    Extensions contain methods which are called upon startup and shutdown of the bootstrapper.
    The methods of the extensions are extension points which can consume information
    gathered during the bootstrapping process for example configuration. Extensions
    are added directly on the bootstrapper.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="Extension_Resolver"></a>Extension Resolver<a href="#Extension_Resolver"
        ></a></h3>
<p>
    An extension resolver allows to plug in extensions into the bootstrapper. All extensions
    which are resolved by the extension resolver are added after manually added extensions.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="Behaviors"></a>Behaviors<a href="#Behaviors" ></a></h3>
<p>
    Behaviors allow to extend the bootstrapping process in an aspect oriented style.
    Behaviors gain access to extensions which are participating in the bootstrapper
    process and can therefore influence them for example by injecting additional runtime
    information into an extension.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="Strategy"></a>Strategy<a href="#Strategy" ></a></h3>
<p>
    The strategy defines the order of execution for extension points and behaviors.
    The strategy is also the context provider for context information which needs to
    be passed to the extension points. The strategy allows to hooking in custom executors,
    extension resolver and reporting context.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="Executors"></a>Executors<a href="#Executors" ></a></h3>
<p>
    Executors are responsible for executing extension points on extensions and the behaviors
    attached to it. Different executors can be used for the startup and shutdown phase
    of the application.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="Core_behaviors"></a>Core behaviors<a href="#Core_behaviors" ></a></h3>
<p>
    The bootstrapper package ships with some core behaviors which can be plugged into
    your bootstrapping mechanism. Core behaviors include
    <ul>
        <li>Support to automatically load configuration sections </li>
        <li>Support for bootstrapper configuration sections which are basically key/value pairs
            and their values get automatically propagated to properties of extensions </li>
        <li>Support to automatically dispose extensions which implement IDisposable </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="Reporting"></a>Reporting<a href="#Reporting" ></a></h3>
<p>
    The bootstrapper records the bootstrapping process and allows reporting the whole
    process to a reporter. This can be used to automatically generate architecture and
    design documents which describe the bootstrapping mechanism.
