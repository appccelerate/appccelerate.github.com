<h2>Exception Handling</h2>

<h3>Exceptions thrown by the Event Broker</h3>
<p>
The event broker will throw an exception during registration when
<ul>
  <li>the publisher or subscriber was already registered for the event topic</li>
  <li>the publisher and subscriber do not match (handler restrictions, publisher event args not assignable to subscriber event args</li>
  <li>the event or handler method signature cannot be handled</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Exceptions thrown by Subscribers</h3>
<p>
When a subscriber throws an exception while handling an event it depends on whether the handler is synchronous or asynchronous.
An exception thrown by a synchronous handler is passed to the publisher. 
An exception of an asynchronous handler can only be catched by the global .net background thread exception handler.
</p>
<p>
You can get better control over exception throwing subscribers by implementing an 
<a href="eventbrokerextensions.html">extension</a>. All built-in handlers call 
<code>SubscriberExceptionOccurred</code> on all extensions. An extension can then mark the exception as handled
and the event broker won't re-throw the exception.
</p>
