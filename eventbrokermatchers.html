<h2>Matchers</h2>
<p>
Matchers can be used to take control of the routing of events. 
A matcher can prevent that an event is passed to a certain subscriber. 
</p>
<p>
An example of this is, that an event that can be canceled is passed to further subscribers when it is already canceled. 
</p>
<p>
Or an event should only be passed to a subscriber matching a certain criteria. 
For example if your application monitors several instruments and for each instrument there is a monitoring view.
A matcher can be used to route events from an instrument only to its corresponding monitoring view.
</p>


<h3>Global, Publisher and Subscriber Matchers</h3>
<p>
Matchers can be defined on a single publication or subscription, or globally on the event broker:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
eventBroker.AddGlobalMatcher(new MyGlobalMatcher());

[EventPublication("topic://Topic", typeof(MyPublicationMatcher))]

[EventSubscription("topic://Topic", typeof(OnPublisher), typeof(MySubscriptionMatcher))]
]]></script>

<h3>Built-in Matchers</h3>

<h4>Not already canceled Matcher</h4>
<p>
When you add the <code>NotAlreadyCanceled</code> subscription matcher to a subscription on an event with
<code>CancelEventArgs</code>, the handler method will only be called by the event broker if the event is not already canceled.
is only called 
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
[EventSubscription("topic://Cancel", typeof(OnPublisher), typeof(NotAlreadyCanceled))]
public void HandleEvent(object sender, CancelEventArgs cancelEventArgs)
{ ... }
]]></script>
<p>
The matcher can be used with other types of event arguments and will try to cast it. 
It will however not prevent the call to the subscriber in case of other event arguments types.
</p>

<h4>Scope Matcher</h4>
<p>
Publishers and subscribers can be named by implementing the <code>INamedItem</code> interface. 
This interface provides a single property:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
string EventBrokerItemName { get; }
]]></script>
<p>
This allows identifying an object within the event broker whereas the publication and subscription attributes are always bound to the class.
</p>
<p>
The naming is hierarchical by using the same scheme as namespaces:
<ul>
  <li>Test is a parent of Test.MyPublisher1</li>
  <li>Test.MyName1 is a sibling of Test.MyName2</li>
  <li>Test.MyName1.Subname is a child of Test.MyName1</li>
  <li>Test.MyName1 is a twin of Test.MyName1 (two objects with the same name are twins)</li>
</ul>
Now, a publisher can define the scope it wants to publish the event to, by defining a matcher in the publication attribute:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
[EventPublication("topic://Topic")]
public event EventHandler PublishedGlobally;

[EventPublication("topic://Topic", typeof(ScopeMatchers.PublishToParents)]
public event EventHandler PublishedToParentsAndTwinsOnly;

[EventPublication("topic://Topic", typeof(ScopeMatchers.PublishToChildren)]
public event EventHandler PublishedToChildrenAndTwinsOnly;
]]></script>
<p>
The first event is a global event that all subscribers can receive. 
The second event is only passed to subscribers that are parents or twins of the publisher. 
The third event is only passed to subscribers that are children or twins of the publisher.
</p>
<p>
A subscriber can define the scope it wants to receive events from accordingly:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
[EventSubscription("topic://Topic", typeof(OnPublisher)]
public void GlobalHandler(object sender, EventArgs e)

[EventSubscription(
    "topic://Topic", 
    typeof(OnPublisher), 
    typeof(ScopeMatchers.SubscribeToParents)]
public void ParentHandler(object sender, EventArgs e)

[EventSubscription(
    "topic://Topic", 
    typeof(OnPublisher), 
    typeof(ScopeMatchers.SubscribeToChildren)]
public void ChildrenHandler(object sender, EventArgs e)
]]></script>
<p>
The first subscription is a global subscription that will handle all the events passed to it. 
The second subscription will only be called when a parent of the subscriber is firing the event. 
The third subscription will only be called when a child of the subscriber is firing the event.
</p>
<p>
Twins (different objects with the same name) are handled specially. 
A twin is always a parent and child of its twin, and will therefore always receive all the events from its twin.
</p>


<h3>Build your own Matcher</h3>
<p>
You can implement your own matcher by implementing the <code>IMatcher</code> interface.
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
/// <summary>
/// Interface for matchers.
/// Matchers are used to determine whether an event is handled
/// depending on the state of the publisher and subscriber.
/// </summary>
public interface IMatcher
{
	/// <summary>
	/// Returns whether the publication and subscription match and the event published by the
	/// publisher will be relayed to the subscriber.
	/// </summary>
	/// <param name="publication">The publication.</param>
	/// <param name="subscription">The subscription.</param>
	/// <param name="e">The <see cref="System.EventArgs"/> instance containing the event data.</param>
	/// <returns><code>true</code> if event has to be sent to the subscriber.</returns>
	bool Match(IPublication publication, ISubscription subscription, EventArgs e);

	/// <summary>
	/// Describes this subscription matcher.
	/// </summary>
	/// <param name="writer">The writer the description is written to.</param>
	void DescribeTo(TextWriter writer);
}
]]></script>
<p>
The matcher gets access to the publisher, the subscriber and the event arguments.
The event broker relays the event from the publisher to the subscriber only if the matcher returns <code>true</code>.
</p>
<p>
If you want to access further information of the publishers and subscribers, it's best to let them implement an interface the matcher 
casts the publisher and subscriber to and access a property or method to get the information needed.
