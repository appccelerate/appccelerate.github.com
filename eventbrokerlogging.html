<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>
There exists a log4net extension that provides logging using log4net. 
Please, download the nuget package Appccelerate.SourceTemplates to get the sample code. 
You can either take the source as is, or change it so it meets your logging requirements.
</p>
<p>
You can add an instance of the Appccelerate.Log4Net.EventbrokerLogExtension to the event broker:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
eventBroker.AddExtension(new Log4Net.EventBrokerLogExtension());
]]></script>
<p>
You can define the logger that log4net uses by specifing the name in the constructor:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
eventBroker.AddExtension(new Log4Net.EventBrokerLogExtension("my.logger.name"));
]]></script>


<h3>Custom Logging</h3>
<p>
If you want to change either the logging framework or what and how is logged then you can write your own logging extension.
See <a href="eventbrokerextensions.html">extensions</a> on how to implement an extension.
