<h2>Fork Repository/Repositories on GitHub</h2>
<p>
Go to <a href="https://github.com/appccelerate">Appccelerate on GitHub</a> and fork the repository or repositories you want to contribute to.
</p>
<p>
There are repositories that depend on each other. As long as you don't change the public API, you don't need to update the dependent repositories.
</p>

<h2>Clone Fork Locally</h2>
<p>
Clone your fork to your machine.
</p>

<h2>First Build</h2>
<p>
Open the solution file inside the <code>source</code> folder with Visual Studio and compile.
</p>
<p>
Visual Studio will restore all the Nuget packages that the solution depends on.
(See Trouble Shooting below if restore does not work).
</p>

<h2>Change Code</h2>
<p>
Go ahead and improve the code.
</p>

<h2>Run Tests</h2>
<p>
There are a lot of tests built into the build process. Please verify that you can build with release configuration before opening a pull request.
</p>
<p>
If the build succeeds, you are ready to open a pull request. 
Otherwise, the error message hopefully points you in the right direction.
For more info on what is checked and how to resolve the issues, see <a href="howtocontributeconcepts.html">Appccelerate Concepts</a>.
</p>

<h2>Open Pull Request</h2>
<p>
Push your changes to your fork on GitHub and open a pull request on the corresponding Appccelerate repository (master branch).
</p>
<p>
Please add some description about what your goal is with the changes.
</p>

<h2>Test your own Nuget Package</h2>
<p>
After you opened a pull request, our Continuous Integration server will automatically be triggered.
It will try to merge your changes, build, create a Nuget package and publish the Nuget package onto the Appccelerate feed (<code>https://www.myget.org/F/appccelerate/</code>) as a pre-release.
</p>
<p>
You can download or update to your own package by getting the pre-release package built from your changes .
</p>
<p>
It will probably be the latest package. The pre-release part contains the sha of the merge commit.
</p>

<h2>Wait for Review Feedback</h2>
<p>
You will get feedback about your pull request on GitHub.
</p>
<p>
Please note that our spare time is limited :-)
</p>
<p>
If you want our feedback from the very beginning, you can open a pull request directly after forking the repository.
This way, every time you push to your repository, a new Nuget package with your current changes is created.
</p>
<p>
After all is well, your pull request gets accepted and you are a contributor to Appccelerate. Thanks!
</p>

<h2>Repeat</h2>
<p>
Now it's time to add some more...
</p>


<h2>Trouble Shooting</h2>
<h3>Packages cannot be restored</h3>
<p>
Add the URL <code>https://www.myget.org/F/appccelerate/</code> as a package source to your Nuget configuration.
You can do this either in Visual Studio or with
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
nuget sources Add -Name Appccelerate -Source https://www.myget.org/F/appccelerate/
]]></script>
<p>
<i>We added a nuget.config to every project of Appccelerate. That should tell nuget to use the Appccelerate feed, but unfortunately, it does not work on all machines.</i>
</p>
<p>
We stage all Appccelerate Nuget packges on this feed before they are released to Nuget.org.
</p>
<h3>Pull Request cannot be merged</h3>
<p>
Make sure that your repository is up-to-date regarding the main repository.
Pull all commits from the main repository.
