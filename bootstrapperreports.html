<h2><a name="Reporting"></a>Reporting<a href="#Reporting" class="section_anchor"></a></h2>
<p>The reporting mechanism allows creating a full report of the bootstrapping process. To be able to report the bootstrapping process the process must actually run and a reporter must be present. By default the bootstrapper uses a null reporter which does nothing with the report. But it is also possible to hook in a report generator which creates Visio, Enterprise Architect or ... (you name it!) diagrams.  </p>
<p>A custom reporter must implement the reporter interface <tt>IReporter</tt>. The reporter receives an <tt>IReportingContext</tt> which contains all necessary information about the bootstrapping process. The custom reporter must be passed upon the construction of the <tt>DefaultBootstrapper<TExtension></tt>. </p>

<p>The reporting context is structured like the following: </p>
