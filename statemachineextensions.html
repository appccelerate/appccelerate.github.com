<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>
Extensions are used to change or access internals of the state machine. 
For example logging can easily be implemented with an extension.
</p>


<h3>Changing the Behaviour of a State Machine</h3>
<p>
Extensions can change the behaviour of the state machine in these ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>change the state into which the state machine is initialized</li>
  <li>change the event and/or event arguments fired on the state machine</li>
  <li>change the exceptions thrown by the state machine with custom exceptions</li>
  <li>Firing events on the state machine as a reaction to a call on the extension (e.g. perform transition to the error state on an exception)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Interface</h3>
<p>
A state machine extension has to implement the <code>IExtension&lt;TState, TEvent&gt;</code> interface.
</p>
<p>
You can use the <code>ExtensionBase</code> class in the namespace <code>Appccelerate.StateMachine.Extensions</code> 
to derive your extensions. The <code>ExtensionBase</code> class implements all interface members with virtual methods.
