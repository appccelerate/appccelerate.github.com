<p>
All components provided by Appccelerate were design in a way so that your code will be loosly coupled, easy to test and easy to extend and maintain.
</p>
<p>
The fundamental design rule behind Appccelerate is:
</p>
<p class="success">It is designed well if it can be removed easily.</p>

<h3>Quality Matters</h3>
<p>
All code newly added to Appccelerate, is implemented using Acceptance Test Driven Development and Test Driven Development.
This guarantees easy to use APIs and a high level of quality (check out our issue tracker on github!).
</p>
<p>
We use the following measures for quality assurance:
<ul>
  <li>ATTD and TDD to develop code.</li>
  <li>StyleCop to check our code for readability so that bugs can't hide.</li>
  <li>Code Analysis/FxCop to check our code for potential design, localization, performance, and security problems.</li>
  <li>Continuous Integration and Packaging using TeamCity, NAnt, Nuget.</li>
  <li>Code coverage to spot weak points after refactoring of code.</li>
  <li>Restructure101 to keep our code without tanggles. (Thanks to Headway Software for providing Urs a license)</li>
  <li>NCover to check our code for structural problems. (Thanks to Patrick Smacchia for providing Urs a license)</li>
</ul>
