<h2>User Interface Thread Synchronizer</h2>
<p>
With the <code>UserInterfaceThreadSynchronizer</code> you can execute code on the user interface thread from any thread.
This is usefull when an operation runs on a worker thread and needs for example to update a label on the UI or needs to create a UI component for later usage.
</p>
<p>
The user interface thread synchronizer needs to be created on the user interface thread. Otherwise, it is not capable of switching to the user interface thread.
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
var synchronizer = new UserInterfaceThreadSynchronizer();
]]></script>
<p>
Later, you can use the user interface thread synchronizer to execute code on the UI thread:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
synchronizer.Execute(() => { /* this code will be executed on UI thread */ });
]]></script>
<p>
This will block the worker thread and execute the action specified on the user interface thread.
You can also pass up to four arguments to the <code>Execute</code> method:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
synchronizer.Execute(
    (a, b) => { /* this code will be executed on UI thread */ }, 
	17, 
	42);
]]></script>
<p>
You can return values back to the worker thread:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
var result = synchronizer.Execute(() => { return 42; });
]]></script>
<p>
And you can execute the action asynchronously. Obviously, it's not possible to return a value.
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
synchronizer.ExecuteAsync(() => { /* executed asynchronously on UI thread */ });
]]></script>

<h3>Testability</h3>
<p>
For simpler tests, you can tell the user interface thread synchronizer to run synchronously by passing a <code>SyncrhonizationContext</code> in the constructor:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
var synchronizer = new UserInterfaceThreadSynchronizer(new SynchronisationContext());
]]></script>
<p>
Now, all actiosn are executed synchronously when <code>Execute</code> or <code>ExecuteAsync</code> is called.
