<h2>Execute Asynchronous Operation</h2>
<p>
Instantiate an async worker and call <code>RunWorkerAsync</code> to start execution of the worker delegate on a background thread.
</p>

<h3>Simple Async Operation</h3>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
DoWorkEventHandler worker = delegate
{
    // take your time to do something because you will not block anyone...
};

AsyncWorker asyncWorker = new AsyncWorker(worker);

asyncWorker.RunWorkerAsync();
]]></script>

<h3>Async Operation with Arguments</h3>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
DoWorkEventHandler worker = delegate(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
{
    // do something with the argument 
	//(unfortunately not type safe - please blame .net and not me)
    string argument = (string)e.Argument;
};

AsyncWorker asyncWorker = new AsyncWorker(worker);

asyncWorker.RunWorkerAsync("hello world");
]]></script>
