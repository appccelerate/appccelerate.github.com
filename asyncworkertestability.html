<h2>Testability</h2>
<p>
To simplify testing, you should never instantiate an async worker directly, but inject an <code>IAsyncWorker</code>.
In production code you can inject a real <code>AsyncWorker</code>. In test code you can inject a fake object that executes the delegates synchronously.
Thus simplifying testing because no multi.threading handling is necessary.
