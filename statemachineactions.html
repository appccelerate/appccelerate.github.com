<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>
Actions are used to execute code when a transition is executed.
Actions can be defined on a transition or on a state as either entry or exit action.
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
]]></script>

<h3>Transition Actions</h3>
<p>
The actions attached to a transition are executed when the transition is taken.
Several actions on a single transition can be defined with multiple <code>Execute</code> calls.
There exist several overloads of the <code>Execute</code> method so you can define actions is different ways: 
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
stateMachine.In(States.A)
    .On(Events.B).Goto(States.B)
	    .Execute(() => { ... })    // use lambda
		.Execute(this.SomeMethod)  // use a method with signature void Method()
]]></script>

<h4>Accessing Event Argument</h4>
<p>
When you pass an argument in the <code>Fire</code> method on the state machine, this argument gets passed to the transition action
in case the transition action takes an argument.
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
stateMachine.In(States.A)
    .On(Events.B).Goto(States.B)
	    .Execute((int i) => { ... })    // use lambda
		.Execute<int>(this.SomeMethod)  // use a method with signature void Method(int i)
]]></script>
<p>
You can use argumentless lambdas or methods in case an argument was passed along with the <code>Fire</code>.
However, if the argument passed cannot be casted to the type specified by a transition action with an argument, an exception is thrown.
Therefore, I suggest that you use only one type of event arguments inside a single state machine and if necessary, 
cast the value yourself in the action if possible.
</p>
<p>
When <code>Fire</code> is invoked without an event argument but the transition action expects an argument, 
the default value of the expected argument type is passed to the action.
</p>

<h3>Entry and Exit Actions</h3>
<p>
Entry and exit actions are attached to a state. the get executed when a transition ends or starts in this state.
Several entry and exit actions can be defined on a single state.
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
stateMachine.In(States.A)
    .ExecuteOnEntry(() => { ... })   // use lambda
	.ExecuteOnEntry(this.SomeMethod) // method with signature void Method()
	.ExecuteOnExit(() => { ... })    // use lambda
	.ExecuteOnExit(this.SomeMethod)  // method with signature void Method()
]]></script>

<h4>Parametrized Entry and Exit Actions</h4>
<p>
Parametrized entry and exit actions simplify using actions that toggle states when the state is entered or left.
The same action can be used, with different parameter values.
You can for example use this to enable a button when the state is entered and disable the button when the state is left. To do this, define a ToggleButton method that takes a bool as input and specify <code>true</code> as the parameter in the entry action and <code>false</code> in
the exit action:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
stateMachine.In(States.A)
    .ExecuteOnEntry(this.ToggleButton, true)
	.ExecuteOnExit(this.ToggleButton, false);	
]]></script>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
private void ToggleButton(bool enable)
{
    this.someButton.Enabled = enable;
}
]]></script>
<p>
Of course, you can use any type for a parameter.
</p>

<h4>Accessing Event Argument</h4>
<p>
Entry and exit actions can access the event argument, too.
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp"><![CDATA[
stateMachine.In(States.A)
    .ExecuteOnEntry((string s) => { ... })
	.ExecuteOnEntry<string>(this.SomeMethodWithStringArgument)
	.ExecuteOnExit((string s) => { ... })
	.ExecuteOnExit<string>(this.SomeMethodWithStringArgument);
]]></script>
<p>
<strong>Important:</strong> When the state machine is initialized and enters its initial state, there won't be an event argument. 
Therefore, you have to make sure that either the initial state does not have an entry action with an argument or can 
execute when the default value of the type of the expected argument is pass to it.
</p>
<p>
When <code>Fire</code> is invoked without an event argument but the entry or exit action expects an argument, 
the default value of the expected argument type is passed to the action.
</p>

<h3>Order of Execution</h3>
<p>
Actions are executed in the following order:
<ol>
	<li>Exit actions in order of definition</li>
	<li>Transition actions in order of definition</li>
	<li>Entry actions in order of definition</li>
</ol>
Actions of the same type are always executed in the order in which you have defined them in the state machine definition.
</p>
